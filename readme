**project description:**
       - This is deep learning project for the detection of underwater species.
       - It is a YoloV8 based detection model trained on the dataset collected from various sources.
       - The dataset is basically splitted in 8:2.
       - This model can be used in both real time video detection and detection in images.

**steps to run**
       - In final.py file alter the necessary paths accordingly.

       - In terminal run:
              - conda create -n underwater python=3.9
              - pip install -r ./MODEL/Requirements.txt
              - python final.py (This will run the final.py file)

**files and folders details**
       - aqua_dataset folder is a folder containing the dataset.
       - new is a folder of other images used for testing.
       - runs is a folder of files created by training the model.
       - best.pt file inside ./MODEL/runs/detect/train16/best.pt is the final weight+arch file.(**provide the path for this file in final.py correctly**)
       - new.py is used for dataset preprocessing [note:no need to run this file].
       - main.py is used for training the model [note:no need to run this file].
       - final.py is used for prediction [**note:run only this file**]
       - yolov8n.pt is the basic yolov8 weight file from ultralytics.(**provide the path for this file in final.py correctly**)
       - **provide the path for the image to be tested correctly in final.py**
